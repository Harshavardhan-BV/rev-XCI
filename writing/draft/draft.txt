\section{Results}
We have considered the two X-chromosomes as interacting entities in a phenomenological modelling framework. We have fit different interaction topologies to the data and compared the best fits among them.

We tested the cross-regulatory connections by fixing the self-regulatory connection to be activatory and tried out the different possibilities. The metrics for a good fit are a lower sum of square errors and a higher $R^2$. So in these heatmaps, a more red value is better. The incoming connection to $X_i$ does not matter as much for the full reactivation case. However, the incoming connection to $X_a$ being inhibitory gives a better fit. Similarly, the incoming connection to $X_a$ being inhibitory for the partial reactivation case gives a better fit. Whereas the incoming connection to $X_i$ does not matter as much.

Similarly, we tested the cross-regulatory connections by fixing the self-regulatory connection as inhibitory and trying out the different possibilities. Here, we observe that the case that fits best for the full reactivation is when both the cross-connections are inhibitory. Whereas, for the partial reactivation case, as observed before, the incoming connection to $X_a$ being inhibitory gives a better fit, and the connection to $X_i$ does not matter.

Finally, we tested the self-regulatory connections while the cross-regulatory connections were kept fixed as inhibitory. For the full reactivation case, we observe that the connection to $X_a$ being inhibitory gives a good fit regardless of the connection to $X_i$. The case where both being self activatory also perform well. However, when we go to partial reactivation, all these fail, and the case where both are self-inhibitory performs the best. 

Although we have cases where certain topologies fit best, the double cross inhibitory and double self inhibitory perform reasonably well and consistently across cases, leading us to consider it the likely topology. However, the meaning behind these connections is something that needs to be explored. During reactivation, certain factors are found to interact with the X-Chromosome. One hypothesis is that competition for these factors could act as these inhibitory edges. Otherwise, these factors could also mediate the interactions between the chromosomes through some signalling. 

However, for the difference between the two cases, we can look at the coefficients of each term which can act as a proxy for the strength of connections. The cross-inhibition on $X_i$ given by $a_1$ is higher in the case of partial reactivation, whereas the cross-inhibition on $X_a$ given by $a_2$ is lower in the case of partial reactivation. The self inhibition on $X_a$ given by $b_2$ is higher in the case of partial reactivation, whereas the self-inhibition on $X_i$ is negligible in both cases.

\section{Methods}
We have considered the two X-chromosomes as interacting entities, and they are modelled as differential equations given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dX_i}{dt} = \underbrace{a_1\ f(K_1,X_a,n)}_\text{cross} + \underbrace{b_1\ f(K_3,X_i,n)}_\text{self} - \underbrace{c_1 X_i}_\text{decay}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dX_a}{dt} = \underbrace{a_2\ f(K_2,X_i,n)}_\text{cross} + \underbrace{b_2\ f(K_4,X_a,n)}_\text{self} - \underbrace{c_2 X_a}_\text{decay}
\end{equation}
Where, 
\begin{equation}
    f(K,X,n) = 
    \begin{cases} 
        \frac{{X}^n}{{K}^n+{X}^n} & \text{if activatory}\\
        \frac{{K}^n}{{K}^n+{X}^n} & \text{if inhibitory}\\
        0 & \text{if neutral}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$X_i$ is the expression level of the inactive X, $X_a$ is the expression level of the active X, $a, b, and c$ are the coefficients for cross-regulatory, self-regulatory and decay terms, respectively, $n$ is the hill coefficient, $K$ are the <what are these>. For simplicity, the X: Autosomal expression ratio is considered for $X_a$ and $X_i$ since the same value scales them.

These equations are fit to the time course data for iPSC reprogramming and extrapolated partial reactivation. This was done by minimizing the sum of square error using \texttt{differential\_evolution} of \texttt{scipy}. Initial parameters are sampled using Sobol sampling, and the differential equations are solved. Then, the sum of square errors between this solution evaluated at the given time points and the actual data is calculated. This is fed back into a differential evolution algorithm where the best-performing parameters are used for the next generation until a minimum is reached.
