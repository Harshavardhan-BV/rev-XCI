\section{Results}

Having one inactivated X chromosome is a natural state of the cells. Coupled with the fact that X chromosome inactivation is random, these observations indicate an antagonistic relationship between the two X chromosomes. However, the observations during iPSC induction contradict such a relationship, owing to the similar activation levels of both the X chromosomes. Therefore, we decided to understand this relationship further using the dynamic X:A data for the chromosomes during partial and complete reactivation of the X-chromosome. We hence generated a mathematical model where each X chromosome is considered as a single entity and asked what nature of interactions between the two chromosomes best explain the observed dynamics in the X:A ratio during partial activation as well as iPSC induction. Without loss of generality, we use the X:A ratio as the level of that particular chromosome.

First, we verified the fits using antagonistic/inhibitory cross-regulation between the two chromosomes. We obtained poor fits (\autoref{IINN}), suggestive of the fact that the model must be modified. We then added activatory self-regulations for each chromosome. The fits obtained by the addition of self-activations are much better than those without self-activations (\autoref{IIAA}). Similarly, the fits obtained by the addition of self-inhibition are also satisfactory (\autoref{IIII-full}). This indicates that some form of self-regulation is necessary to explain the observed dynamics.

% The rationale being that the upregulated X does not lose its upregulation until a threshold activation level of the XCI reached which can be explained by the upregulated chromosome having a self-activation property which serves to contest the inhibition from the inactivation chromosome. 
We then consider all combinations of cross-regulatory links (interactions between the chromosomes) and self-regulatory links (interactions within a chromosome, for example, the expression of some genes on the chromosome enhancing the expression of other genes on the same chromosome via epigenetic modifications) (\autoref{topo}). We generated heatmaps with a color scheme such that the red color indicates a higher $R^2$, indicative of a good fit.

We first tested the self-regulatory connections while the cross-regulatory connections were kept fixed as inhibitory. For the full reactivation case (\autoref{rsq-self-full}), we observe that the connection to $X_a$ being inhibitory gives a good fit regardless of the connection to $X_i$. The case where both are self-activatory also performs well. However, for the case of partial reactivation (\autoref{rsq-self-part}, \autoref{IIII-part}), most of these fail, and only the case where both are self-inhibitory performs the best.

Then we tested the cross-regulatory connections while fixing the self-regulatory connection as inhibitory. Here, we observe that the case that best fits the full reactivation case (\autoref{rsq-cross-i-full}) is when both the cross-connections are inhibitory. Whereas, for the partial reactivation case (\autoref{rsq-cross-i-part}), the incoming connection to  $X_a$ being inhibitory gives a better fit, while the connection to $X_i$ being activatory performs slightly better.

Similarly, we also tested the cross-regulatory connections while fixing the self-regulatory connection to be activatory. We find that the incoming connection to $X_i$ does not matter as much for the full reactivation case (\autoref{rsq-cross-a-full}). However, the incoming connection to $X_a$ being inhibitory gives a better fit. Similarly, the incoming connection to $X_a$ being inhibitory for the partial reactivation case (\autoref{rsq-cross-a-part}) gives a better fit, whereas the incoming connection to $X_i$ does not matter as much.

% Although we have cases where certain combinations of regulatory connections fit best, the double cross inhibitory and double self-inhibitory perform reasonably well and consistently across cases, leading us to consider it be the likely interactions (\autoref{IIII-full}, ). 

Our results indicate that the self-inhibition with cross-inhibitory regulation explains the reactivation dynamics consistently well for both partial and full reactivation. Despite the ability of our phenomenological model to explain the observed experimental data, it falls short of revealing the specific mechanisms mediating such interactions among the chromosomes. One possibility is that the cross-inhibition identified above corresponds to competition between the two chromosomes for specific resources and/or interactions mediated by regulatory factors that are pertinent during random X-inactivation \cite{XCI}.

Finally, to identify the difference between the two cases (full vs. partial reactivation), we quantified the coefficients of each term which can act as a proxy for the strength of connections (\autoref{IIII-parm}). The cross-inhibition on $X_i$ given by $a_1$ is higher in the case of partial reactivation, whereas the cross-inhibition on $X_a$ given by $a_2$ is lower in the case of partial reactivation. The self-inhibition on $X_a$ given by $b_2$ is higher in the case of partial reactivation, whereas the self-inhibition on $X_i$ is negligible in both cases. This sensitivity analysis indicated the relative role of different interactions in mediating partial versus full reactivation dynamics.

\section{Methods}

We have considered the two X-chromosomes as interacting entities, and they are modeled as differential equations given by:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dX_i}{dt} = \underbrace{a_1\ f(K_1,X_a,n)}_\text{cross} + \underbrace{b_1\ f(K_3,X_i,n)}_\text{self} - \underbrace{c_1 X_i}_\text{decay}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dX_a}{dt} = \underbrace{a_2\ f(K_2,X_i,n)}_\text{cross} + \underbrace{b_2\ f(K_4,X_a,n)}_\text{self} - \underbrace{c_2 X_a}_\text{decay}
\end{equation}
Where, 
\begin{equation}
    f(K,X,n) = 
    \begin{cases} 
        \frac{{X}^n}{{K}^n+{X}^n} & \text{if activatory}\\
        \frac{{K}^n}{{K}^n+{X}^n} & \text{if inhibitory}\\
        0 & \text{if neutral}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

$X_i$ is the expression level of the inactive X given as X:A ratio, $X_a$ is the expression level of the active X given as X:A ratio, $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, c_1$ and $c_2$ are the coefficients for cross-regulatory, self-regulatory and decay terms, respectively, $n$ is the hill coefficient, $K_1,K_2,K_3$ and $K_4$ are the half-saturation constants.

These equations are fit to the time course data for iPSC reprogramming and extrapolated partial reactivation. This was done by minimizing the sum of square error using the \texttt{differential\_evolution} algorithm of \texttt{scipy}. The initial population of parameters is sampled using Sobol sampling. The differential equations are solved using the explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) with these parameters. Then, the sum of square errors between the solutions evaluated at the given time points and the actual data is calculated. A new parameter set is generated by adding a weighted difference between two randomly chosen parameter sets to a third parameter set, similar to a mutation. Then, it randomly combines parameters from the old set with this new set, similar to crossover. The sum of square errors with this new set of parameters is also evaluated and compared with those of the old parameters. If the values are lower with the new set, they replace the old set in the next generation of the population. This is repeated multiple times until an optimal solution is found \cite{DEalgo}.
