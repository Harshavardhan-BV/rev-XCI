abstract = { Excerpt The monograph by Ohno makes interesting reading for anyone who has been either observing or participating in the unusually rapid expansion in our knowledge of the X chromosome in the last 10 years. Its broad evolutionary and comparative biological view distinguishes Ohno's book. He contrasts the X chromosome of mammals with that of Drosophilia with regard, for example, to the means of achieving dosage compensation for X-linked genes. The relatively constant size of the X chromosome and the homology of X-linked genes in placental mammals—matters to which Ohno was early in calling attention—are discussed in detail. Ohno is a Ph.D.... }

abstract = {Phenotypic (non-genetic) heterogeneity has significant implications for the development and evolution of organs, organisms, and populations. Recent observations in multiple cancers have unraveled the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in driving metastasis and therapy recalcitrance. However, the origins of such phenotypic heterogeneity are poorly understood in most cancers. Here, we investigate a regulatory network underlying phenotypic heterogeneity in small cell lung cancer, a devastating disease with no molecular targeted therapy. Discrete and continuous dynamical simulations of this network reveal its multistable behavior that can explain co-existence of four experimentally observed phenotypes. Analysis of the network topology uncovers that multistability emerges from two teams of players that mutually inhibit each other, but members of a team activate one another, forming a ‘toggle switch’ between the two teams. Deciphering these topological signatures in cancer-related regulatory networks can unravel their ‘latent’ design principles and offer a rational approach to characterize phenotypic heterogeneity in a tumor.},

abstract = {Summary
In mammals, transcriptional inactivation of one X chromosome in female compensates for the dosage of X-linked gene expression between the sexes. Additionally, it is believed that the upregulation of active X chromosome in male and female balances the dosage of X-linked gene expression relative to autosomal genes, as proposed by Ohno. However, the existence of X chromosome upregulation (XCU) remains controversial. Here, we have profiled gene-wise dynamics of XCU in pre-gastrulation mouse embryos at single-cell level and found that XCU is dynamically linked with X chromosome inactivation (XCI); however, XCU is not global like XCI. Moreover, we show that upregulated genes are enriched with activating marks and have enhanced burst frequency. Finally, our In-silico model predicts that recruitment probabilities of activating factors and a surge of these factors upon X-inactivation trigger XCU. Altogether, our study provides significant insight into the gene-wise dynamics and mechanistic basis of XCU during early development and extends support for Ohno’s hypothesis.}

abstract = {Dramatic epigenetic changes take place during mammalian differentiation from the naïve pluripotent state including the silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in female cells through X chromosome inactivation. Conversely, reprogramming of somatic cells to naive pluripotency is coupled to X chromosome reactivation (XCR). Recent studies in the mouse system have shed light on the mechanisms of XCR by uncovering the timing and steps of XCR during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), allowing the generation of testable hypotheses during embryogenesis. In contrast, analyses of the X chromosome in human iPSCs have revealed important differences between mouse and human reprogramming processes that can partially be explained by the establishment of distinct pluripotent states and impact disease modeling and the application of human pluripotent stem cells. Here, we review recent literature on XCR as a readout and determinant of reprogramming to pluripotency.}
